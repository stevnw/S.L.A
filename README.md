# S.L.A
S.L.A - Flashcard and Quiz tool for language learning. S.L.A has 2 main modes - "learn" and "match". Learn is like flashcards, where you go through the deck. Match is a game where you have to match the correct meaning to the word/phrase.

## Note:

This program features 3 display themes: light, dark and sepia. 

This program is provided as is. <i><b>I have not included any datasets with it.</i></b> It makes uses .tsv files in the format:

<pre> Language_Word/Phrase  Meaning  Blank_Column  Sound </pre>

All audio has to be .wav. A valid file path can be something like:

<pre> audio/00001.wav </pre>

e.g.

<pre> Hej / Hallo	Hello		audio/00002.wav </pre>

File structure looks like:

<pre> audio (folder)  config.txt  SLA-1.1-standalone.jar  Xefjord_Danish.tsv </pre>

My intended use for this is as an alternative to Anki for sorted data from Anki decks, e.g. [Xefjord's Complete Language Series](https://xefjord.wixsite.com/xefscompletelangs/courses) 

Check out my Anki Add-on for a quick way to pull data sets from Anki: https://github.com/stevnw/ExportWithAudio-Anki

<sub>S.L.A stands for Swing Language Application - in case you were wondering hehe</sub>
