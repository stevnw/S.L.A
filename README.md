# S.L.A
S.L.A - Flashcard and Quiz tool for language learning. S.L.A has 2 main modes - "learn" and "match". Learn is like flashcards, where you go through the deck. Match is a game where you have to match the correct meaning to the word/phrase.

This program is provided as is. I have not included any datasets with it. It makes uses .tsv files in the format:

<pre> Language_Word/Phrase  Meaning  Blank_Column  Sound </pre>

My personal intent is to use it as an alternative to Anki for data from Anki decks, like [Xefjord's Complete Language Series](https://xefjord.wixsite.com/xefscompletelangs/courses) 

<sub>S.L.A stands for Swing Language Application - in case you were wondering hehe</sub>
